monianskvho allegerij that he h d made a league with the king
of Persia o overthrow Greece. ἰ39. The chief men of Corcyra
said that they were afraid that the Lacedaemonians and Atheni·
ans would make war on them because they had received Themis·

protect him, Themistocles is said to have taken the king's little

protection. 41. “If I am carried by the storrn to Naxos,”
said Themistocles, “I must perish, since the army of the
Atheniens is there.” 42. Τ hemistocles told the master of the
ship who he was, and said that he would give him many gifts
if he would save him. 43. When the master of the ship was
seized with pity and had taken Themistocles to Ephesus, the
latter said that afterwards he would requitc⁸ him for his service.

to Asia when Xerxes was king, Nepos says that he believes
Thucydides when he says that Themistocles went to Artaxerxes.

said that although he had inflicted very many injuries on the
PersianS, he would be a good friend of the king if he should
obtain his friendship. 46. Themistocles said that he had
informed Xerxes by a letter that the Greeks were going to
destroy the bridge which the king had made over the Helles·
pont. 47. The king said that he would pardon Themistocles,
because he admired his high spirit.⁴ 48. After Themistocles
had given the space os a year to the literature and language of
the Persians, he was able to speak more elegantly than the
native Persians. 49. The king said: “I will give you three
cities, - Magnesia to fumish you with bread, Lampsacus fronr
which you may get wine, and Myus to supply you with dainties.''

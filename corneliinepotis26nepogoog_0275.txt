‘pb‘proof Now there wasa youth· from Argilus, to whom Pausa-
Ι] nias had given a letter for Artabazus! He suspected that Pau-
fflbbanias had written something abou him, because no one of
those who had carried letters from Pausanias to Artabazus had
ever returned. So he opened² the letter and found that
Pausanias had ordered that he be lrilled. So the youth fled

to the shrine of Neptune at Taenarum,³ and sat on the altar as

a suppliant of the god. Pausanias came to the same piace,
and ashed the Argilian why he had done this. The youth
replied that he had found out that if he delivered the letter

to Artabazus, he must die. When Pausanias begged him not

to tell what he had learned, the ephors, who were in a place
under ground near the temple of Neptune, heard what was
said, and returned to Sparta with Pausanias, in order to arrest
him in the city. But Pausanias is said to have guessed⁴ from

the face of one of the ephors that he was going to be arrested,

and to have fled into the temple of Minerva. The ephors
ordered the doors of the temple to be blocked up, and the
roof to be destroyed, and his own mother is said to have
brought the first stone. Pausanias died near the temple, after

he had been carried out half dead, and was buried not far off.

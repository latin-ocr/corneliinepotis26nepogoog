PREFACE

Iu this edition of the Lt'ves of Cornelius Nepos, the text is in
main that of Fleckeisen (Leipzig, 1890), with a few changes in
orthography and punctuation. In orthography and in marking
the quantities Lewis's “Latin Dictionary for Schools'' and
“Elementary Latin Dictionary” have been followed, except
in the case of obvious misprints. In the difficult matter of
“ hidden quantities,” the editor does not wish to be understood
as agreeing in all cases with¹ Dr. Lewis, but he believes that
uniformity on the subject of quantity and orthography is
highly desirable in our school text-books, and that agreement
on those subjects can be best reached by following the stand-

The grammatical references¹ in the Norns are intended to

help the pupil to grasp the writer’s meaning, and not for the
purposes of “ parsing.” The editor firmly believes that all the
“ parsing ” that is necessary should be done before translating,
and that instruction in syntax should be given entirely by
practice in turning English into Latin. For this purpose the
Exnncrsus noa Tnausunnou nuo Lanu have been prepared.
In accordance with the recommendation of the Latin Con·
ference of 1892, these exercises have been confined to a
limited portion of the Tnxn (about thirty pages). The editor

books, seems to have been the chief authority ior the lives oi
Hamilcar and Hannibal, although Nepos does uot always agree
with him. Sasilus and Silenus, who served in Hannibal’s army ’
and wrote an account of the second Punic war, are cited by
Nepos 3¹ also Sulpicius Blitho, who is known to us only by

name.
’ in some ol his lives Nepos makes statemeuts which are not
supported by any of our authorities, and must have been

derived from some unknown source. In his lise of Epami· .

nondas,² he says that ‘very many writers’ wrote biographies oi
illustrious men, and these he very probably had before him.
Of such writers we know of Antigonus Carystius, Hermippus
the Penpatctic, and Satyrus among the Greeks 3 and Marcus
Terentius Varro and Santra among the Romans.

Two well-known writers of later times to some extent
described the same events, and used the same sources as
Nepos. These are Diodorus Siculus, who in the time ol
ἱ Augustus wrote a Unr'aersal Irlr'stary in iorty books 3 and Plu-
tarch (46-120 nn), from whom we have forty-six Parallel
Liaes of illustrious Greeks aud Romans. With these writers
Nepos is frequently in conflict, although sometimes he agrees
with them against the testimony of the earlier authorities.

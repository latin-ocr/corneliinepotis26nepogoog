TRANSLATION INTO LATIN · 237

After King Darius had made war on the Scythiam, and had

been unsuccessful,¹ he was urged by his friends to reduce Greece =

under his power. Accordingly he built a fleet, of which Datis
and Artaphernes were given the command,² and sent it against
the Athenians. They went first to Eretria, which they captured,
and then to Attica, where they encamped in the plain of Mara-
thon, which is about teu miles from the city. The Atheniens
sent to Lacedaemon to ask for aid, and also elected ten generals
at home, one of whom was Miltiades.

It is said that there was a dispute among the generals,
whether to go to meet the enemy or to remain³ in the city,
but that Miltiades persuaded them to light.⁴ He drew up his
troops at the foot of a mountain, together with a thousand
Plataean soldiers who had come to the aid⁵ of the Athenians.
The Persians attaeked them, but were utterly defeated.

11. THEMISTOCLES.

1. Nepos says that few are considered equal to Themistocles
in ability. 2. It happened⁰ that Themistocles so neglected his
property that he was disinherited by his father. 3. He thought

that he must devote' himself wholly to his country, in order to ’

blot out the disgrace. 4. Thucydides tells us that Themis-
tocles judged present events very sagaciously, and formed con-
jectures about future events very clearly. l
5. Themistocles will be made general by the people, to carry
on the war¹ with Corcyra. 6. Let us persuade the people to
'buitd a fleet with the money which comes from the mines.
7. When Themistocles had persuaded the Athenians to build a
fleet, they became so skilled in naval war that they crushed the
Corcyreans. 8. The report was brought to Athens that Xerxes
was going to make war 010ss Europe both by land and by sea.

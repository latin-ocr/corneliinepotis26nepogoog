2. Chronica, referred to by Catullus in his dedication to
Nepos, This work comprised in three books an outline of
the world’s history from the earliest times until the author's
own day. lt was probably, like the Annalis of Atticus,1 of a
chronological character.

3. Exempla, a moral treatise in at least five books,² draw-
ing a comparison between the manners and customs of early
Rome and those of his own day.

4. A Lzye of Cato, mentioned by Nepos himself.8

5. A sze of Cicero, a· panegyric, apparently composed after
the death of the orator.

6. A Treutise on Geogruplzy, of which little or nothing is
known.

7. D? Viris Illustribus, his last and greatest work. This
consisted of, at least, sixteen books. He arranged his biog-

raphies in classes or groups, giving two books to each class
The first book of every class included the distinguished men
of foreign nations, mostly of Greece3 while the second treated
those of Rome. The following outline of Nipperdey, though
open to question in some particulars, gives a good idea of the
scope and arrangement of the work : —

1. De Rth'bus Exterdrum Gentium.
ΙΙ. ΗΞ Regibus Rbmdnorum.
111. DZ Excellentibus Ducibus Exterdrum Gentium.
IV. De Excellentibus Ducibus Romanorum.
V: Di Iuris Consultis Graecis.

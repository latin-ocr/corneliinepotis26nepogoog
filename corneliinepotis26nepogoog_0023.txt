INTRODUCHON xv

cites Thucydides in his life of Themistocles,¹ and says that he
followed him in preference to ‘many other writers' whom he
consulted; but he differs from him in several particulars. In
his lives of Pausanias, Cimon, and Alcibiades Nepos follows
Thucydides more closely, but he does not appear on the
whole to have recognized the importance of the Peloponneson
Wor as an authority.
⁸ 3. Xenophon (from about 434 until after 359 nc). His
Helleuico, in seven books, narrares the history of Greece from
411 n.c.-at which point the work of Thucydides ends-
until the battle of Mantinea in 362 nc. This work Nepos
seems not to have consulted 5 he is in direct conflict with it
in several of his lives. In his life of Agesilaus, Nepos cites
Xenophon as an authority. The work referred to is the Agesi-
laus, apanegyric of the Spartan king. This work Nepos fol-
lows closely in some parts of his own account of Agesilaus.
Some modern scholars deny that Xenophon wrote the Agesi-
laus, but it was accepted as his.without question in ancient
times. Α
- 4. Philistus, of Syracuse, a contemporary of the Dionysii,
is mentioned by Nepos in his life of Dion, and may very likely
have been one of his authorities. He wrote the Sicilico
in thirteen books, of which the first seven treated the early
history of Sicily until the beginning of the rule of the elder
Dionysius (400 nc), the next four, the reign of the elder
Dionysius (until 366 n.c.); and the last two, that of the ·
younger Dionysius (until 362 sels

5. Ephorus, of Cyme in Aeolia (died about 340 nc). He
wrote the first Um'oersol History os Graece, in thirty-eight
books, beginning with the return of the Heracleidae and end-

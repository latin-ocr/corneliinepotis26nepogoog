¹ Owing to the great number of proper names in the Lines, it bas been thought best to
publish these rules. They were prepared by Professor Α. Η. Pattengill, of the Univer·
sity of Michigan, and have been used by him for several years. They are given without
change, except that the examples have been taken as far as possible from the text.

The marks of quantity are intended to indicate the sound of the vowels in English.

, ing with the siege of Perinthus in 340 nc. Nepos does not
mention EphoruS, but his work, which was widely read although
ol secondary value asan authority, seems to have been one of
our author’s chief sources ol information.

6. Theopompus, of Chios (bom about 380 nc). He wrote
the Helketion, in twelve books, which was, like the Hellenica
of Xenophon, a continuation ol the work of Thucydides, cov-
ering the period from 410 nc. until the battle of Cnidos iu
394 nc, and also the Philiopico, in fifty-eight books, a his-
tory of the reign of Philip of Macedon, but with numerous
digressions, in the course osone of which he devoted tbree
books to the history of Sicily. Theopompus seems to have
lacked the impartiality which should characterize the' historian.
Nepos, who cites him, calls him mokdicenlissimus scriptor,¹

and Polybius censures his partiality in his account ol King l
Philip. He was, however, a valuable authority, and was much ¹

used by Nepos. Ἴ

7. Timaeus, of Tauromena in Sicily (about ³52 to 256 nc). ζ
He wrote a Histoty os Sicily, in thirty-eight books, from the
earliest times until 246 nc, with numerous digressionsl He
was a careful historian, and a good authority, but had the same
failing as Theopompus, Nepos couples him with Theopompus
as a mokdz'centtisimos scriptor, and among the Greeks he was ,
known as Ἐπιτίμαιος, ‘the Carpen’ Our author seems to have
made considerable use ol Timaeus in his lives of Alcibiades,
Dion, and Timoleon.

8. Dinon wrote a History of Persio down to 34⁰ ac, which
Nepos cites as of great value.²

9. Polybius, of Megalopolis (²05 to 134 nc), one oi the
very best Greek historians. His Um'oerral History, in sorty 1

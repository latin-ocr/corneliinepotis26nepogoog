For his lives os generals of foreign nations he had an abun-
dance of good authorities at his command, many of whom he
mentions by narne; buthe seems not always to have chosen
wisely among them, and sometimes to have misunderstood
thern. He is careless in details: his chronology is confused,
he makes mistakes in history and geography, and his work is
marred by contradictions and omissions. On the other hand,
he touches on most points of interest in Grecian history, and
for that reason, as well as on account of their simple style,

Some allowance should be made for his shortcomings in view
of the fact, that in his day the Romans were just beginning
to cultivate the writing of history as an art ; and because he
was the first Roman writer to treat the history of foreign Ι
nations.

Greeks and Persians, with numerous digressions in which the
history of other nations is treated. .The work was divided by
some one of the grammarians into nine books, to which the
names of the nine Muses were given. Nepos does not men·

ln his life of Miltiades he is at variance with Herodotus in
several details.

2. Thucydides (about 455 to 400 ac.) undertook a Irlzlrtory ,
of tlte Peloponnesian War, of which eight books, describing
the course of events until 411 n.c., were completed. Nepos

THE LIFE AND WORKS OF NEPOs

i. st or Nanos.

Continuus Nauos was born in Cisalpine Gaul, the native
country of Catullus, Vergil, and Livy. The elder Pliny¹ speaks
of him as Parsa accola ,· and since we know that he was a
native-of that part of Cisalpine Gaul which was called Insu-
bria‚ it has been assumed with considerable probability ⁴that
his birthplace was Ticinum, the modern Pavia

The dates of his birth and death are not certainly known,
but he appears to have lived from 99 to 24 rac. We know
that he survived Atticus who died in 32 ac, and that he lived
to a good old age. His praeahmen is unknown.

Nepos took up his residence at Rome early in life. He
seems to have had an independent fortune and to have
devoted his whole attention to literary pursuits. He took no
part in politics; at least, we know from one of Pliny’s letters²
that he was not of senatorial rank, and therefore that he had
not held 'even a quaestorship.

He was on terms of intimacy with Cicer0, Atticus, and
Catullus. Catullus dedicated his book of poems to Nepos in
the following complimentary lines :⁸-

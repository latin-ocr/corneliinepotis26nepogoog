one of Livy. As Asinius Pollio found a certain ‘Patavinity’
in the language of Livy, who was, like Nepos, a native of
Cisalpine Gaul, it is possible that some of the stylistic peculiar-
ities of our author may be due to his provincial origin.

The deviations of Nepos from classical usage have been
unduly exaggerated by those who have endeavored to prove
that Probus was the author of the Lives. Many of his inegu·
larities may be paralleled in Caesar and Cicero, and still more
in Livy. As Nipperdey says, we must remember that Caesar
and Cicero represent the highest literary perfectiori of their
time 3 a period which includes Varro, and the writers of the
Bellum Afn'ccinum and Bellum Hispanrinse, also has room for
astylist like Cornelius Nepos. His Latin is pure enough to
prove beyond question that the Lives could have been written
only in the Classical Period.

Since it is desirable that beginners in Latin writing use only

regular constructions‚ the important deviations of Nepos from .

good classica] usage are pointed out in the Nouus. The
teacher should consult the exhaustive monograph of Lupus,
Der Spraclrgcbrauclr des Cornelius Nepos, Berlin, 1876.

As history the work of Nepos is not of great value. His
list of generals is not remarkably well chosen, for we miss
some great names, such as Brasidas, Aratos, Philopoemen, and
Cleomenes ; and the space allotted to each is by no means
proportionate to the importance of the subject of the biog-
raphy. Nepos is inclined to exaggeration, and he lacks the
critical faculty. It hasbeen said that his worlr does more
credit to his heart than to his head, and this is notably the

case in his biography of his friend Atticus.

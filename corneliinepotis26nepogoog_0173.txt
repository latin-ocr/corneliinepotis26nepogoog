PREFACE.

1. Nt'sn dubito foro plerosque: ‘I do not doubt that there will
be very many people.' The best Latin writers use quin and the
subj. with non dubito, meaning ‘I do not doubt.' Nepos commonly
uses the acc. and the inf, although he occasionally uses the subj.
(eg. p. 114, l. 29). See B. 298, and a3 A. 319, d; G. 555, 2, and
w.; H. 505, 1, 1. plerosque: here and frequently in Nepos:
plurimos. . Attico: T. Pomponius Attalus, to whom the work is
dedicated. See p. 120 fol. 2. etnon: instead of neque, because
no‘n modifies satis especially. 3. personis: ‘characters’ Per-
sona means, first, the mask worn by actors on the stage, then the
character personated by the actors. F or the case, see Β. 226, 2;

and 23 A. 320,a; G. 631,2; H. 503,1. relatum: part. agree-
ing with the subst. clause quis . . . docuerit. musicam . . .

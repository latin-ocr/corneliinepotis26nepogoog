Pnon ⁷] MILTIADES 1 47

great many cases of the perf. subj. in a result clause after a past
tense. See B. 268, 63 A. 287,c; G. 5133 H. 495, vr. In this
socalled exception to the rule of the ‘sequence of the tenses,' the
verb of the result clauseis independent so faras its tense is con-
cemed. When the imp. subj. is used, the result is more closely
connected with the time represented by the main verb.

Pege ⁷. 1. petierint: see note on profligarint, p. 6, l. 32.
2. adhinc: i.e. up to the writer's own time. nobilius: ‘more
famous’ Note the derivation3 see Vocab. nulla enim um-
quam tam exigua manns: ‘for never did so small a force.' In
Eng. we transfer the negative to the adv. 3. opes: ‘power,'
including men, ships, money, and resources of all kinds.

VL 4. Citius vlotc'nriae: ‘for this victory,' gen. modifying
praenukm. Note the order, which is involved but natural. Read
the sentence caresully through in tlte Latin order, noting the end·
ings of the words and their relation to one another. alienum:
‘out of place,' i.e. foreign to the subject. 5. qud: ‘in order
that.' Why is qno used rather than ut f 6. eandem: predi-
cate adj, emphatic position. 7. quondam: ‘in former times'
8. effusi: ‘lavish,' contrasted with both rdrz‘ and tenues, while
obsoleti, ‘worthless,' lit. ‘worn out‚' is contrasted with gloriosi.
11. liberarat: :liberaverat tilis honos tribfitus est, etc:
note the order; cf. note to l. 4, above. talis tonos is explained by
the clause ut . . . committeret,⁸ the clause cum . . . depingeretur,
which modifies the ut clause, is put before it, instead of being in·
cluded within it, an order of which Nepos is rather fond. tulis =
hic, as is frequently the case in Nepos. The special honor was
that Miltiades was represented as foremost among the ten generals,
encouraging the soldiers and directing the battle. 15. largitione
magistratuum: it is not clear to what Nepos refers. He probably
speaks generally, and with some confusion of Greek and Roman
conditions. ’

vu 21. plerasque: sc. insulas. 22. Parum: see map of
Greece in the front of the book, G. 4. opibus elatam: ‘full of
confidence in its strength’3 for the meaning of opz'bus see l. 3,
· above. Parum: object of reconciliare. The position of cum is ¹
not unusual; cf. l. 12, above. 24. vineis ao teatridinibus:

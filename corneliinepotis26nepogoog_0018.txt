INTRODUCTION

Cui dono lepidum novum libellum
Arido modo pumice expolitum}
Corneli, tibi; namque tu solebas
Meas esse aliquid putare nugas,

Iam tum cum ausus es unus italorum
Omne aevum tribus explicare chartis,
Doctis, Iuppiter, et laboriosis!
Quare habe tibi quidquid hoc libelli
Qualecumque, quod, o patrona virgo,
Plus uno maneat perenne saeclo-¹

Itis believed by some, from a reference of Front0, that
Nepos, like his friend Atticus, was a publisher as well as a
wr1ter.

ii. Tus Womts or Nmos

Nepos was a ‘prolific writer in several different departments

of literature. Most of his works have been lost and are
known tous only through references to them by other writers.
They included the following : -

1. Love poems, mentioned hy the younger Pliny in the
letter cited above.

1T ranslated as follows by Robinson Ellis, ¹ Τὴε Poems and Fragments oi
Catullus, Translated iu the Metres of the Original,' London, 1871 :—

Who shall take thee, the new, the dainty volume,
Purfled glossily, fresh with ashy pumice?

You Comelius; you of old did hold them
Something worthy, the petty witty nothings,

While you venture, alone of all Italians,
Time's vast chronicle in three books to circle,
Jove, how arduous, how divinely leamedl

Tberefore welcome it, yours the little outcast‚
This slight volume. O yet, supreme awarder‚
Virgin, save it in ages ou forever.
